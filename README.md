## This repo contains road traffic data and code for the analysis. 

### The code shows how to aggregate and visualize the road traffic data by creating insight on road traffic patterns that emerge during the working days and the weekend. 

The data comes from the Emilia-Romagna Regional Road Traffic Flow Monitoring System (MTS), created by the Emilia Romagna Region, the Provinces, and Italian road traffic authority ANAS.

It consists of 283 monitoring sensors, operating 24 hours a day, installed primarily on state and provincial roads. Consultation and download of traffic flows allows the use of data collected by the MTS System, managed by the Roads, Logistics, Waterways, and Airports Department.

This service provides data aggregated on a monthly, daily, and hourly basis.

Monthly and daily data are automatically published monthly, on the first day of each month, and refer to the second month prior.
